<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to build a web platform called **The Social Circle**. The initial concept was a mentor-learner marketplace, but it has pivoted to a premium, curated networking platform connecting Hosts and Guests for intimate micro-events and dinners, initially launching in Delhi NCR.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Platform Name:** The Social Circle
- **Tagline:** Real Connections. Curated Dinners.
- **User Roles:** Guest (formerly User), Host (formerly Mentor), Admin.
- **Core Flow:**
    1.  Public users can browse all events without logging in.
    2.  To apply for an event, a user must sign up/log in as a Guest.
    3.  A Host can create and manage events, setting details like title, description, capacity, and price per lead.
    4.  Guest applications become locked leads for the Host.
    5.  The Host pays a fee (using a demo payment system for now with a special code) to unlock the guest applications/leads.
    6.  The Host reviews the unlocked applications and selects which Guests to invite.
    7.  Selected Guests receive a notification and are prompted to pay for their event ticket.
    8.  Upon successful payment, the Guest receives a confirmation ticket.
- **Authentication:** Email/Password and Google Social Login. Email verification via Resend is required for new sign-ups.
- **Admin Panel:** An admin dashboard (hidden from regular users) is required for approving/rejecting hosts and managing the platform.
- **UI/UX:**
    -   Use a provided logo.
    -   The brand color is **Dark Navy Blue**, with a clean, minimal, and premium aesthetic.
    -   A footer with links to Privacy Policy, Terms & Conditions, Refund Policy, and a Contact page is required.
- **Content:** All content (text, labels, etc.) should be updated to reflect the Social Circle branding and dinner/event hosting model.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A full-stack FastAPI/React application has been built and rebranded as The Social Circle. It includes:
- Role-based authentication for Guests, Hosts, and Admins.
- Dashboards for all three roles.
- Functionality for hosts to create events and view leads.
- A demo payment system (replacing Razorpay) for hosts to purchase leads.
- An email verification system using Resend is coded but requires an API key to be functional.
- The UI reflects the new Dark Navy Blue color scheme and logo.
- Static pages for policies (Privacy, Terms, Refund) and a Contact page have been created.
- A comprehensive  and  are available.

**Last working item**:
The user requested a new, enhanced workflow for guest selection and ticketing after a host purchases leads.

-   **Last item agent was working:** Implementing the new guest selection and ticket payment flow, where hosts select guests from a dashboard, and those guests are then prompted to pay for a ticket.
-   **Status:** NOT STARTED
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both (frontend and backend testing agents are recommended for this significant feature).
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Events are not visible to non-logged-in users (P0)
-   Issue 2: Minor JSON parsing error during manual mentor/host flow testing (P2)

**Issues Detail:**
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   **Description:** The user reported in chat 231 that events are not visible on the landing page without signing in. This contradicts a core requirement. The backend endpoint () is public, so the issue is likely in the frontend.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None. The agent was diverted to another task before addressing this.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        -   Examine .
        -   Verify that the  hook responsible for fetching events is not wrapped within a component or logic that requires authentication.
        -   Ensure the API call is being made on the initial page load for all visitors.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** This is a critical bug. Fixing it will allow potential users to see the available events, which is essential for attracting sign-ups and engaging users.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (a screenshot of the landing page as a logged-out user should suffice).
-   **Issue 2:**
    -   **Description:** In chat 76, the agent noted a  while manually testing the mentor flow but dismissed it and moved on. The root cause was never investigated.
    -   **Attempted fixes:** None.
    -   **Next debug checklist:**
        -   Re-run the test script or manual flow from chat 75/76.
        -   Inspect the backend logs () for the specific API call that failed.
        -   Check the response of the endpoint that is causing the error to ensure it's returning valid JSON.
    -   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** It indicates an unstable API endpoint in the host workflow, which could block hosts from managing their events or leads.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Is recurring issue?** N
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Backend (using curl).

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Implement Enhanced Guest Selection & Ticketing Flow (P0)

**Task Detail:**
-   **Task 1:**
    -   **Description:** Implement the feature requested in chat 239. After a host pays to unlock leads, they should see the leads on their dashboard, be able to select guests, and trigger a payment request for an event ticket to the selected guests.
    -   **Where to resume:**
        1.  **Backend:** Plan and implement new API endpoints:
            -   An endpoint for a host to select/invite a guest for an event.
            -   An endpoint for a guest to view their invitations.
            -   An endpoint for a guest to pay for an event ticket.
            -   Update database models to track invitation status and ticket payment.
        2.  **Frontend:** Plan and implement new UI components:
            -   In the Host Dashboard, create a UI for viewing and selecting guests from unlocked leads.
            -   In the Guest Dashboard, create a section to display event invitations.
            -   Create a payment flow/page for guests to purchase their ticket.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** This will complete the core business logic of the platform, creating a full circle from event creation to a confirmed, paid guest.
    -   **Status:** NOT STARTED
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
-   **Upcoming Tasks:**
    -   **Refactor Component Names (P1):** Rename files and components still using Mentor or User (e.g., ) to Host and Guest for consistency (e.g., ).
    -   **Configure Resend API Key (P1):** The email verification flow is implemented but needs a  in  to function. A guide for the user has been created ().
-   **Future Tasks:**
    -   **Implement Real Payment Gateway:** Replace the demo payment system with a production-ready gateway like Stripe or Razorpay. The original Razorpay code is commented out in .
    -   **Implement AI Polish Feature:** The user's content description mentioned an AI Polish button for event descriptions. This has not been implemented.

**Completed work in this session**
-   Full-stack application skeleton for a two-sided marketplace.
-   Complete rebranding from LeadBridge (mentor platform) to The Social Circle (event hosting platform).
-   Role-based authentication (Guest, Host, Admin) with JWT and Google Auth.
-   Functional dashboards for all three roles.
-   Event creation and public browsing.
-   Lead generation flow (guest applies, host sees lead).
-   **Recently completed:**
    -   UI updated with new logo and Dark Navy Blue theme.
    -   Demo payment gateway implemented to replace Razorpay for lead purchases.
    -   Footer and static pages (Privacy, T&C, Refund, Contact) created.
    -   Email verification system using Resend implemented (pending API key).
    -   Comprehensive  and  created.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Issue 1:** A test agent run () reported that the admin login returned a 'USER' role instead of 'ADMIN'. The main agent manually verified this and found it was working correctly, dismissing it as a potential transient issue or flaky test. This was not investigated further.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Backend:** FastAPI (Python)
-   **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
-   **Database:** MongoDB
-   **Authentication:** JWT (email/password) & Google OAuth
-   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS

**key DB schema**
-   **users:** 
-   **events:** 
-   **bookings:** 
-   **payments:** 

**All files of reference**
-   : Contains all backend logic, API endpoints, and database interactions.
-   : Defines all frontend routes and renders pages.
-   : The main public-facing page.
-   : The Host dashboard (needs renaming).
-   : The Guest dashboard (needs renaming).
-   : The Admin management panel.
-   : Defines the color scheme and design tokens.
-   : Contains updated project documentation.
-   : Contains credentials and steps for testing the user flow.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   Component and file names like  and  should be refactored to  and  to match the current business model (The Social Circle). Terminology within these files should also be updated.
-   The commented-out Razorpay code in  should be removed for clarity, as a demo payment system is now in place.

**key api endpoints**
-   , 
-   
-    (GET all events)
-    (POST to book a slot)
-    (POST to verify demo payment for leads)
-    (PUT to verify a host)

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   The project has pivoted significantly. The current and final focus is **The Social Circle**, an event hosting platform. All mentor/learner context and code should be ignored or refactored.
-   The payment gateway for hosts to buy leads is a **demo system**. It works by POSTing to  with a hardcoded . The original Razorpay implementation is commented out.
-   Email verification is implemented but **requires a Resend API key**. The user needs to add  to  for it to work.
-   There is a critical bug preventing non-logged-in users from seeing events. This is the highest priority fix.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (Latest):** Requested a new feature: after a host pays for leads, they should see them on their dashboard, be able to select guests, and then the selected guests should be prompted to pay for a ticket.
2.  **User:** Provided a testing guide with credentials.
3.  **User:** Reported a bug: events arent visible without signin".
4.  **User:** Asked to update the whole README file.
5.  **Agent:** Summarized the rebranding to "The Social Circle" and asked what to prioritize next.
6.  **Agent:** Took a screenshot of the new "Social Circle" landing page.
7.  **User:** Provided detailed content and context for a major pivot to "The Social Circle", a dinner/event hosting platform. Clarified that the functionality is fine, but content needs to be tweaked.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken:** The event visibility for non-logged-in users is broken.
-   **Mocked:** The payment gateway for purchasing leads is a mocked demo endpoint. The upcoming guest ticket payment system will also need to be mocked initially.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Google Auth:** Emergent-managed integration for social login.
-   **Resend:** Used for the email verification system. Requires a User API Key (`RESEND_API_KEY`).

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes:** YES (used once early on).
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
-   **Test files created:** None. Testing was done via manual `curl` commands and ad-hoc scripts.
-   **Known regressions:** Events are no longer visible to logged-out users.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin:** `admin@leadbridge.com` / `admin123`
-   (Other credentials for host/guest are available in `/app/TESTING_GUIDE.md`)

**What agent forgot to execute**
-   The agent did not fix the **"events arent visible without signin** bug reported by the user, getting sidetracked by another request.
-   The agent never investigated the **minor JSON parsing error** that occurred during manual testing of the mentor/host flow.
-   The agent has not refactored component filenames and internal naming from Mentor/User to Host/Guest after the latest pivot.</analysis>
